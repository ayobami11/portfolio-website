            <p>
                Passionate about creating aesthetically-pleasing and user-friendly website.
                I specialize in transforming pixel-perfect designs into fully-flegded, responsive web interfaces that are accessible and easy to scale.
                With a keen eye for detail, I endeavour to create websites which are not only interactive but perform efficiently across various devices and browsers.
